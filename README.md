# Taxi-Driver (No Passenger) — RL Algorithms

This repo contains three implementations on the same 8×8 custom Gymnasium gridworld:
- **Q-Learning** (tabular, off-policy) — run as a Python script in VS Code, Run the DriverAgent.py
- **SARSA** (tabular, on-policy) — run as a Colab notebook (upload `Map.py` first), Run the driverAgent(SARSA)FINAL.ipynb
- **Value Iteration** (planning) — run as a Python script in VS Code, Run the ValueIterationDriverAgent_Final.py
